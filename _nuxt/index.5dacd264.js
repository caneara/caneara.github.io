In 2022, I formed Caneara to serve as an umbrella for my closed and open-source projects, as well as my client and consulting work. </p><p> I started my journey back in 1999 with Visual Basic, played around with C# for a few years, before finally settling on Laravel and PHP as my preferred platform. Since then, I&#39;ve also come to know and love VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and most recently InertiaJS. </p><p> I&#39;ve built, deployed and maintained client and SaaS projects on servers, and have recently dabbled with serverless via Amazon Web Services and Laravel Vapor. While still a little rough around the edges, it is fast becoming my preferred option. </p><p> While my workload is pretty full these days, I&#39;m always open to the right challenge when it comes to consulting or client work, so please feel free to reach out to me if you&#39;re interested in the two of us working together. </p>',6);function n(i,l,c,d,p,h){return s}const f=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{f as default};
